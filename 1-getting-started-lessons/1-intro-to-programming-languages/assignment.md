# Reading the Docs

## Instructions

There are many tools that a web developer may need that are on the [MDN documentation for client-side tooling](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Overview). Select 3 tools not covered in the lesson, explain why a web developer would use it, and search for a tool that falls under this category and share its documentation. Do not use the same tool example on MDN docs.

Linterns are programs that check code looking for syntax errors or code best practices. Developers can use these programs in order to check if the code is well made and if there are any errors that have to be solved. These programs can be useful so developers dont have to remake the code all over again.

Other programs that they use are source code control programs, which are used so developers can work in teams and not rewrite each other works all over. These are used to push changes on temporary repositories and not having to make changes on the master file until it gets approved.
